## Description:
This is the best way I found to put a Vlog that reflects the content of my YouTube channel's playlist. I have managed to have the description formatted to my liking, but still I wasn't able yet to make the `target=_blank` on the linkify(1.0.0-alpha), I guess we will see if they update it one day.

Features:
..* Youtube API v3 on React.
.. title
.. video
.. description
..* Formatted description.
..* If you have links in your description, they will show as clickable links.
..* The video playlist will show the latest post first on top.


## Eazy to use:
### Steps: 
1. Download or clone repo.
2. Copy needed component to your project.
3. Add the necessary dependencies
..* react-linkify
..* I have use Materialize CSS for the video-container class, but it's really not necessary. (https://materializecss.com/media-css.html).
4. Create and Activate your Youtube API --> https://developers.google.com/youtube
5. Create a `.env` file in your project source (NOT IN THE "src" FOLDER) with your API Key (REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your API key here").
6. You might have to restart your server.
7. Yarn or NPM install and you are good to go!
